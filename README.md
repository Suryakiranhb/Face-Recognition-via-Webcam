# Face-Recognition-via-Webcam
I would recommend changing the directories of 'faces/' and the harr cascade xml file to wherever you plan to keep them in your PC.
The name you set for the dataset folder will be the name displayed when your face is recognized.
Other than that, the code hould work just fine. Make sure that youre using the right version of OpenCV that matches with your python version. Happy Face Recognition!
